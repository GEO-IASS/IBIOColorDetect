A) Why does viewingDistance in a scene affect mosaic image in no blur no noise case?  Who wins, viewing distance or visual angle?

B) Validations, isetbio

C) PTB <-> IBIO display

D) Movie formats for isomerizations/photocurrents

E) Validations, IBIOColorDetect

F) Cleaner CRT interface.  And, I don’t think leakageLum should be added to background, we always calibrate that out.

G) Compare the two versions of colorGaborResponseInstanceGenerate

H) Update IBIOColorDetect visualization routines to use rwObject

I) Stimulus duration set to 0 (in t_…OneFrame)?

J) In fast instance generation, is padding with a fixed number of pixels secure?

K) For writer, how to get unique temp file name (for writing within parfor loops)

L) Visualization code protected so it doesn’t crash but simply doesn’t output when what you need isn’t there, and this should include type of computer things are being run on.
